	\para{Well summer, \textbf{the season of progress}. The season to learn new things and focus on what you really want and build your career.}
	
	\para{After spending one whole semester in the university, it is got clear to me, that \underline{meanwhile} studying, learning \textbf{new}  things, is hard! It's possible but it's hard. So summer is the time which I have to value a lot and to make the most of it.}
	
	\para{At the time of writing this, there are 5 days remaining of the year, a long and hard year both for Iran, my love, and myself. I learned and grew a lot during this year. I spend a whole semester in university, experienced a really \textit{Randomly-Generated-but-Related} journey. Studied a lot, learned how to study well and meet many new and nice people.}
	
	
	\para{But after all, I have to create a path to my actual career! After working and searching I've finally made my decision and chosen: \textit{Data Science}. I really like this field, it's very amazing but hard to learn :) Beside this, I wanna learn backend engineering as well, 'cause it is much faster (faster to get result, lol) and has a slightly smaller learning curve.}
	
	\para{This will be a hot summer. It gets hot because of so many hours I want to study, both with video courses and with reading books. To learn data science I asked someone in our university who already is a data scientist, and he introduced me to the deep learning course of \textit{Jeremy Howard}. This course is freely available on YouTube. Also this course needs a book nearby (written by Jeremy Howard) called \textit{Deep Learning for Coders With Fastai and PyTorch}.}
	
	\para{Refreshing my Python skills is something that I would never miss and enjoy a lot. The focus of this summer will be on the CPython implementation itself, so I've chosen some nice books on this field. I have gathered some more general books on Python too, but they would have a lesser priority.}
	
	\para{Watching video courses and reading books are the main activities of the summer, but without spending or more precisely, \textit{acquiring} time to rest, nobody can learn anything; listening to music and podcast and watching movies are the main non-active and biking is the main physical activity of my summer.}

		\section{Deep learning}
			\epigraph{\sffamily The career I chose, \say{The sexiest job of the 21st century,} \say{The best job in America,} \say{One of the newest and coolest jobs in IT world}{}}
			
			\para{Well as the quote says, this is exciting, BUT it really needs knowledge and effort to gain, the starting point is here: this nice deep learning course at \url{https://course.fast.ai/}.}
			
			\para{\textbf{Practical Deep Learning}}
			\para{\textit{A free course designed for people with some coding experience, who want to learn how to apply deep learning and machine learning to practical problems.}}
			
			\para{\textit{This free course is designed for people (and bunnies!) with some coding experience who want to learn how to apply deep learning and machine learning to practical problems.}}
			
			\para{Each lesson of the course has a video and a dedicated page of the website, like \href{https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html}{Lesson 1}. }
			
			\noindent Notes:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Each video is pretty long, on average they last one hour and 30 minutes! The longer the video, the more knowledge they contain AND the more attention they need AND the more practice as well.
				
				\item Each lesson has a \textit{How to complete lesson N} section (like \url{https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html#how-to-complete-lesson-1},) in which says: \textit{As well as watching the video and working through the notebooks, you should also read the relevent chapter(s) of the fast.ai book, Practical Deep Learning for Coders. Each lesson will tell you what chapter you need to read, just below the video}
			\end{itemize}
		
		    After all, \textsf{the dedicated time and effort must be huge.}
		    	
		\section{FastAPI}
			\epigraph{\sffamily \say{FastAPI framework, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production}}{\href{https://fastapi.tiangolo.com}{fastapi.tiangolo.com}}
			
			\para{We all know FastAPI and there is no need for more introduction.
			The course I wanna watch is \url{https://youtu.be/0sOvCWFmrtA}}
			
			\noindent The course is a 19-hour long video which is downloaded and cut already. The important things are:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The course is created one year ago and it is slightly outdated, so the \href{https://fastapi.tiangolo.com}{documentation} must be read along the course.
				
				\item Course will just show you how to use FastAPI and the real learning happens when doing projects.
				
				\item It's good to define nice projects whenever I came to an idea
				e.g. \textit{The API to send pictures of \url{https://unsplash.com} to my friends} :)
